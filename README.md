# X/O Game Discord Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that allows users to play the X/O game (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) with the bot.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/xo-discord-bot.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a new Discord bot and get its token.
4. Add the bot to your Discord server.
5. Replace the **`your-token-here`** variable in the `xo_discord_bot.py` file with your bot's token.

## Usage

To play the game, send a message in a Discord channel where the bot is present. The bot will prompt you to enter a position on the game board by typing a number between 1 and 9. You will play as the X symbol, and the bot will play as the O symbol.
