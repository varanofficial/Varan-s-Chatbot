## Description

The X/0 game, also known as Tic Tac Toe, is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing either an "X" or an "O" on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all of the squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

The X/0 game is a classic game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. It is a simple game that can be played with nothing more than a pen and paper, and it can also be played on electronic devices, including computers and mobile phones. The game is easy to learn but can become quite challenging as players develop more advanced strategies for winning. It is often used as a teaching tool for young children to develop critical thinking skills and to learn about decision-making and strategy.

## Usage

To play the game, send a message in a Discord channel where the bot is present. The bot will prompt you to enter a position on the game board by typing a number between 1 and 9. You will play as the X symbol, and the bot will play as the O symbol.
